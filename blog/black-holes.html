        <p>A black hole is a region of spacetime where gravity is so strong that nothing—no particles or even electromagnetic radiation such as light—can escape from it. The theory of general relativity predicts that a sufficiently compact mass can deform spacetime to form a black hole.</p>

        <h2>The Event Horizon</h2>
        <p>The boundary of the region from which no escape is possible is called the event horizon. Although the event horizon has an enormous effect on the fate and circumstances of an object crossing it, it has no locally detectable features.</p>

        <h2>Singularity</h2>
        <p>At the center of a black hole, as described by general relativity, lies a gravitational singularity, a region where the spacetime curvature becomes infinite. For a non-rotating black hole, this region takes the shape of a single point; for a rotating black hole, it is smeared out to form a ring singularity lying in the plane of rotation.</p>

        <h2>Spaghettification</h2>
        <p>If you were to fall into a black hole, the tidal forces would be extreme. The gravity pulling on your feet would be much stronger than the gravity pulling on your head. This would stretch you vertically and compress you horizontally in a process astronomers cheerfully call "spaghettification."</p>
