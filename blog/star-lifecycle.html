        <p>Stars are not eternal. Like living organisms, they are born, they live through various stages, and eventually, they die. The lifespan and ultimate fate of a star are determined almost entirely by one factor: its initial mass.</p>

        <h2>1. The Nebula (Birth)</h2>
        <p>All stars begin as clouds of gas and dust called nebulae. Gravity causes these clouds to collapse. As they shrink, they spin faster and heat up, eventually forming a Protostar.</p>

        <h2>2. Main Sequence</h2>
        <p>Once the core temperature reaches roughly 15 million degrees Celsius, nuclear fusion begins. Hydrogen fuses into helium, releasing massive amounts of energy. This is the stage our Sun is currently in, and it balances the inward pull of gravity with the outward pressure of fusion.</p>

        <h2>3. The Red Giant</h2>
        <p>When hydrogen runs out, the star's core collapses while the outer layers expand and cool. The star becomes a Red Giant. It may engulf nearby planets—a fate that awaits Earth in about 5 billion years.</p>

        <h2>4. The Finale</h2>
        <p><strong>Low Mass Stars:</strong> They shed their outer layers to form a planetary nebula, leaving behind a small, hot White Dwarf.</p>
        <p><strong>High Mass Stars:</strong> They undergo a violent explosion called a Supernova. The remnant becomes either a Neutron Star or, if the mass is sufficient, a Black Hole.</p>
