# Description
⚠️ Experimental Build: This is the [WebAssembly (WASM)](https://webassembly.org) version of Survival Test 0.30. While it often provides higher framerates, it may crash on older browsers or Chromebooks. If you experience issues, please use a different Minecraft version like [1.5.2](play?game=eaglercraft-1.5.2).

[Minecraft Survival Test 0.30](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Java_Edition_Classic_0.30) was an early survival mode released on November 10, 2009, by [Notch (Markus Persson)](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Notch). This version introduced core survival mechanics including health, hostile mobs like zombies, skeletons, creepers, and spiders, as well as passive mobs like pigs and sheep. Players earn points by killing mobs and must survive as long as possible. With no crafting, hunger, or inventory system yet, this primitive survival experience showcases the earliest foundations of [Minecraft's](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Minecraft) iconic survival gameplay.

If you want the full survival experience with crafting, inventory, and modern features, try [Minecraft 1.8.8](play?game=eaglercraftx-1.8.8) or [Minecraft 1.12.2](play?game=eaglercraft-1.12.2).
