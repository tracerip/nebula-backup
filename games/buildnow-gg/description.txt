# Description
[BuildNow GG](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.BattleLab.BuildNowGG) is a fast-paced third-person tactical shooter that focuses heavily on building mechanics. Often described as a browser-based alternative to Fortnite, it allows players to battle in 1v1 duels, box fights, and zone wars while constructing ramps, walls, and roofs on the fly to gain the high ground.

Featuring fully customizable controls and cross-platform play, it is the premier destination for practicing your edits and aim without downloading a massive client.

If you enjoy building and creative freedom, you should play [Minecraft 1.8.8](play?game=eaglercraftx-1.8.8), or if you prefer pure shooting action, try [Ultrakill](play?game=ultrakill).
