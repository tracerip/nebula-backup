# Description
Geometry Jump is the infamous, web-exclusive bootleg of the popular rhythm platformer, widely recognized as the "school computer" version. Often found on unblocked sites, this "rough around the edges" remake mimics the core mechanics of the original but features its own set of 15 unique levels, distinctively floaty physics, and generic looping soundtracks.

While it lacks the polish, music, and precision of RobTop's masterpiece, it serves as a chaotic, accessible alternative when the real game is restricted. Prepare for questionable hitboxes and stiff animations in this cult-classic flash/HTML5 clone.

If you are allowed to play the real versions, we highly recommend [Geometry Dash Lite](play?game=gd-lite) or [Geometry Dash World](play?game=gd-world).
