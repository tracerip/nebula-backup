# Description
[Helios](https://github.com/dinguschan-owo/Helios) is a powerful, open-source web proxy designed to function as a "browser within a browser." Created to bypass restrictive admin censorship and "spyware-ridden" school networks, it mimics the interface of Google Chrome while routing your traffic through specialized proxies.

It features advanced capabilities like tab cloaking, local offline access via a single HTML file, and session ID generation to keep your browsing history private. It is the ultimate tool for accessing the unrestricted web from a locked-down device.

If you are looking for an entire operating system in your browser, try [NautilusOS](play?game=nautilusos) or play a game like [GTA Vice City](play?game=gta-vc).
