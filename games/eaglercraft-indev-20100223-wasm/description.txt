# Description
⚠️ Experimental Build: This is the [WebAssembly (WASM)](https://webassembly.org/) version of Indev 20100223. While it often provides higher framerates, it may crash on older browsers or Chromebooks. If you experience issues, please use the [Standard Version](play?game=eaglercraft-indev-20100223).

[Minecraft Indev 20100223](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Java_Edition_Indev_20100223) is a historic development build released on February 23, 2010, by [Notch (Markus Persson)](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Notch). This version introduced paintings and refined the early survival experience. Indev marked a major evolution from Classic, adding crafting, smelting, tools, weapons, torches, chests, and a full day/night cycle with hostile mobs. Players spawn on a finite floating island world and must gather resources to survive.

For a more complete survival experience with infinite worlds, try [Minecraft 1.8.8](play?game=eaglercraft-1.8.8) or [Minecraft 1.12.2](play?game=eaglercraft-1.12.2).
