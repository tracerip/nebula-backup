# Description
[NautilusOS](https://github.com/nautilus-os/NautilusOS) is a sophisticated web-based operating system (webtop) that runs entirely within your browser. It simulates a full desktop environment, complete with a taskbar, window management, and integrated applications like a terminal, code editor, and file manager.

Designed to be lightweight and customizable, it serves as a virtual workspace or a sandbox for testing JavaScript-based applications. It is often used by tech enthusiasts to simulate a computer environment inside another computer, bypassing restrictions and offering a clean, private desktop experience.

If you enjoy technical sandboxes or classic desktop experiences, you should try [EaglercraftX](play?game=eaglercraftx-1.8.8) or the unrestricted proxy [Helios](play?game=helios).
