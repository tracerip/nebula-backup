[Terraria](https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Terraria) is a 2D sandbox action-adventure game developed by [Re-Logic](https://re-logic.com/). Often described as "2D Minecraft," Terraria offers a unique blend of exploration, crafting, building, and intense combat. Players dig, fight, explore, and build in procedurally generated worlds filled with diverse biomes, hidden treasures, and over 20 challenging boss battles. With thousands of items to craft, NPCs to rescue, and secrets to uncover, Terraria provides hundreds of hours of gameplay across its pre-Hardmode and Hardmode progression.

If you're looking for a 3D sandbox experience, try [Minecraft 1.8.8](play?game=eaglercraftx-1.8.8) or [Minecraft 1.12.2](play?game=eaglercraft-1.12.2).
