# Description
[Hollow Knight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollow_Knight) is a critically acclaimed 2D Metroidvania that invites you to explore the twisting caverns of a ruined kingdom called Hallownest. Beneath the fading town of Dirtmouth sleeps an ancient, forgotten civilization filled with bizarre insectoid creatures and terrifying bosses.

Celebrated for its tight controls, hand-drawn art style, and punishing difficulty, you must forge your own path, unlock new abilities like the Mothwing Cloak and Mantis Claw, and uncover the mystery at the heart of the kingdom.

If you enjoy deep exploration and challenging boss fights, you should try [Terraria](play?game=terraria) or the intense action of [Ultrakill](play?game=ultrakill).
