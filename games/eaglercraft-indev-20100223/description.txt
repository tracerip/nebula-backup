# Description
[Minecraft Indev 20100223](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Java_Edition_Indev_20100223) is a historic development build released on February 23, 2010, by [Notch (Markus Persson)](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Notch). This version introduced paintings and refined the early survival experience. Indev marked a major evolution from Classic, adding crafting, smelting, tools, weapons, torches, chests, and a full day/night cycle with hostile mobs. Players spawn on a finite floating island world and must gather resources to survive against zombies, skeletons, creepers, and spiders.

Looking for better performance?
We offer an experimental [WASM Version](play?game=eaglercraft-indev-20100223-wasm) of this game. It runs faster on some devices but may not be supported by all browsers.

For a more complete survival experience with infinite worlds, try [Minecraft 1.5.2](play?game=eaglercraft-1.5.2) or [Minecraft 1.8.8](play?game=eaglercraftx-1.8.8).

For a more older and classic survival version, try [Minecraft Classic 0.30](player?game=eaglercraft-classic-0.30).
