# Description
[Minesweeper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winmine.exe) is the timeless logic puzzle classic where you uncover a grid of hidden tiles, using numbers to deduce and flag mine locations without detonating any. Beginner to Expert difficulties, first-click safety, question marks, and high-score chases make it endlessly replayable—perfect for brain-training breaks in your browser with smooth controls and no timers.
