# Description
[Tapper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_Beer_Tapper) is the classic arcade test of reflexes and multitasking. You play as a bartender who must frantically serve frothy mugs of root beer to waves of thirsty customers before they reach the end of the bar.

Sprint between four different taps, slide drinks down the counter, and catch the empty mugs that patrons slide back at you. If you drop a mug or let a customer reach you, it's game over. It is a frantic, high-score focused experience that captures the golden age of gaming.

If you enjoy retro classics, check out [Super Mario 64](play?game=super-mario-64) or the arcade-style puzzle game [Pentablocks](play?game=pentablocks).
