# Description
[Infinite Craft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_Craft) is a viral sandbox game developed by Neal Agarwal that uses generative AI to let you create literally anything. You start with just four basic elements—Water, Fire, Earth, and Wind—and combine them to discover new items, concepts, pop culture icons, and even entire universes.

Unlike traditional crafting games with fixed recipes, Infinite Craft uses a Large Language Model (LLM) to determine the result of your combinations in real-time. This means you can discover "First Discoveries"—unique items that no other player in the world has ever found before.

If you enjoy open-ended creativity, you should also play [EaglercraftX](play?game=eaglercraftx-1.8.8) or the survival sandbox [Terraria](play?game=terraria).
