# Description
[Minesweeper Variation](https://coweggs.itch.io/minesweeper-variation) is a tense twist on classic [Minesweeper](play?game=minesweeper) where every 10 seconds, 3 of your moves get mysteriously reverted, forcing constant adaptation. Safely uncover tiles (first click always mine-free) to reveal adjacent mine counts, flag suspects with right-clicks, and race to clear the board before reversals sabotage your progress in this addictive, brain-teasing browser puzzle.
