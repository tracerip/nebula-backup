# Description
[Bloons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloons) is the iconic physics puzzle game that launched a thousand dart monkeys. Your goal is simple but addictive: pop a target number of balloons in each level using a limited supply of darts. Adjust your angle, manage your power, and use special power-ups like the Bomb, Ice, and Tacks to clear the screen.

It is the game that started it all. Once you have mastered the basics here, challenge yourself with the sequel, [Bloons 2](play?game=bloons-2), or try the fan-made challenges in [Bloons Player Pack 1](play?game=bloons-player-pack).
