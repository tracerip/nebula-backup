# Description
[Bloons Tower Defense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloons_TD_1) is the game that revolutionized the web-based tower defense genre. Instead of solving puzzles, your goal here is to stop waves of balloons from reaching the end of the track. Strategically place Dart Monkeys, Tack Towers, and Bomb Shooters to pop the bloons before they escape.

It establishes the classic addictive formula: Pop bloons, earn money, upgrade towers, and repeat. Once you have mastered the basics, move on to the expanded features in [Bloons Tower Defense 2](play?game=btd-2) or try the puzzle game that started it all, [Bloons](play?game=bloons).
