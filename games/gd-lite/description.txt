# Description
[Geometry Dash Lite](https://store.steampowered.com/app/322170/Geometry_Dash/) ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry_Dash_Lite)) is the free starter edition of the iconic rhythm-based platformer with the first 13 levels (Stereo Madness to Cant Let Go), basic icons, colors, practice mode, and vaults. Spike-dodge, portal-flip, and orb-chain through hazard mazes synced to electro beats—perfect intro to the addictive jump-die-repeat mastery of GD's brutal precision gameplay.
